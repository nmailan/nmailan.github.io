  Mai Lan Nguyen is an actor, writer, and theater-maker. Born to Vietnamese parents, she grew up in Warsaw, Poland while frequenting her hometown in Hanoi. 
  She is currently based in San Diego, California, pursuing her MFA in Acting from UCSD.<br/><br/>

  Before moving to San Diego, Mai Lan earned a Bachelor's in Theater and Performance Studies, along with Bachelor's 
  and Master's degrees in Computer Science, all from Stanford University.
  There, she discovered her love of classics and experimental theater. She was a member of the Asian American Theater Project, the Stanford Shakespeare Company, 
   and Theater Lab.<br/><br/>

  As an artist, Mai Lan is interested in the ideas of distance, absurdity and contradictions. 
  In her work, she is guided by the idea that theater is most impactful when it moves away from literality and one-to-one depictions of reality as we know it. 
  Some of her acting credits include: <i>Cancelina</i> (Meg),  <i>peerless</i> (M), <i>Everybody</i> (SOMEBODY), and <i>The Seagull</i> (Understudy for Arkadina/Masha).
  <br/><br/>

  Outside of acting, she has written and directed multiple short performance pieces and one-acts. Her most recent work includes writing and directing her own adaptation of a 13th-century Chinese play, <i>Snow in Midsummer.</i>
  She has worked as an Assistant Director to Haruna Lee's <i>Beyond the Wound Is A Portal</i> and interned as a production assistant in New York's Target Margin Theater. <br/><br/>
  She is a recipient of the Louis Sudler Prize for Excellence in the Performing Arts (2022).
