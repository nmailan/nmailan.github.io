  Maia Nguyen is an actor and theater-maker whose work lives at the intersection of thought, emotional urgency, and playful rebellion. 
  Born to Vietnamese parents and raised in Poland, she grew up between Warsaw’s vibrant theater scene and the warmth of her family home in Hanoi. 
  From spending countless evenings at local playhouses to creating playful skits as a teenager at <b>Ognisko Teatralne “u Machulskich,”</b> Maia’s early encounters 
  with theater still shape the way she approaches her craft: valuing collaboration, contradictions, and work that looks beyond literal depictions of reality.<br/><br/>
  
  Currently in her final year of pursuing her <b>MFA in Acting at UC San Diego</b>, Maia is also a proud graduate of <b>Stanford University</b>, 
  where she earned a BA in Theater and Performance Studies as well as BS and MS Computer Science. At Stanford, she deepened her love of classics and experimentation,  
  performing with the Asian <b>American Theater Project (AATP)</b>, the <b>Stanford Shakespeare Company</b>, and <b>Theater Lab</b>. With her technical experience in scientific research, 
  and internships at Bay Area startups, Maia has learned to combine an artist’s heart with an engineer’s precision,
   making <i>the best of both worlds</i> (thank you, <i>Hannah Montana</i>).<br/><br/>
  
  As a performer, Maia is drawn to characters that are often caught between control and collapse. 
  She is attracted to stories that span genres but remain character-driven, balancing emotional intensity with absurdity or tragedy with satire. 
  Some of her acting credits include: <b><i>peerless</i> (M), <i>The Rogues’ Trial</i> (John Cricket), <i>One Flea Spare</i> (Morse), <i>Vinegar Tom</i> (Margery), <i>Cancelina</i> (Meg), 
  <i>Everybody</i> (Somebody), <i>The Seagull</i> (u/s Arkadina/Masha), and <i>Indian Princesses</i> (u/s Samantha)</b>.</br></br> 
  
  Outside of acting, Maia has written and directed short performance pieces and one-acts. Through writing, she explores family, power, the tension between heart and mind,
   and the search for meaning. Her most recent work includes writing and directing her own adaptation of a 13th-century Chinese play, <b><i>Snow in Midsummer</b>.</i> 
   She has also served as an Assistant Director to Haruna Lee's <b><i>Beyond the Wound Is A Portal</i></b> and interned as a production assistant in New York's <b>Target Margin Theater</b>. 
   She often travels with her ukulele, plays the piano and writes songs in her spare time.</br></br> 
   
   Maia is a recipient of the <b>Louis Sudler Prize for Excellence in the Performing Arts (2022)</b>.
